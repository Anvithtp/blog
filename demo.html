        <font size = +2><b>5G Network: </b></font>The next technology trend that follows the IoT is 5G.Where 3G and 4G technologies have enabled us to browse the internet,
        use data driven services, increased bandwidths for streaming on Spotify or YouTube and so much more, 
        5G services are expected to revolutionize our lives. by enabling services that rely on 
        advanced technologies like <mark>AR and VR, alongside cloud based gaming services like Google Stadia,
        NVidia GeForce Now and much more</mark>. It is expected to be used in factories, HD cameras that help improve
        safety and traffic management, smart grid control and smart retail too.

    <p>&emsp;&ensp;Just about every telecom company like Verizon, Tmobile, Apple, Nokia Corp, QualComm, are now working on creating 
       5G applications. 5G Networks will cover 40% of the world by 2024, handling 25% of all mobile traffic data making 
       it an emerging technology trend you must watch out for, and also save a spot in.
       5G networks are cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called cells. All 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with 
        a cellular base station via fixed antennas, over frequency channels assigned by the base station. The base stations, termed nodes, are connected to switching centers in the telephone 
        network and routers for Internet access by high-bandwidth optical fiber or wireless backhaul connections. As in other cellular networks, a mobile device moving from one cell to another 
        is automatically handed off seamlessly. 5G is expected to support up to a<mark> million devices per square kilometer</mark>.The industry consortium setting standards for 5G, the 3rd Generation 
        Partnership Project (3GPP), defines "5G" as any system using 5G NR (5G New Radio) software - a definition that came 
        into general use by late 2018.

    <p> &emsp;&ensp;Several network operators use millimeter waves called FR2 in 5G terminology, for additional capacity and higher throughputs. Millimeter waves have a shorter range than the lower
        frequency microwaves, therefore the cells are of a smaller size. Millimeter waves also have more trouble passing through building walls. Millimeter-wave antennas are smaller than 
        the large antennas used in previous cellular networks. Some are only a few centimeters long.
        The increased data rate is achieved partly by using additional higher-frequency radio waves in addition to the low- and medium-band frequencies used in previous cellular networks. 
        For providing a wide range of services, 5G networks can operate in three frequency bands: low, medium, and high.
        5G can be implemented in low-band, mid-band or high-band millimeter-wave 24 GHz up to 54 GHz. Low-band 5G uses a similar fre
